# Filed Feedback

I try to send along as many bug reports and feature requests as I can for the software I use (as long as the reporting process is at all reasonable... ಠ_ಠ Apple) and thought it would be fun to keep a log of them all here.

Can't remember all the ones I've sent in the past but I'll try to add them if/when I remember any.

Please do send in any that strike you as interesting... the more requests they get, the more likely they are to prioritize it!

# GitHub

- [ ] Feature: Return whether a Gist is a fork in the REST API, similar to the responses for regular repos (Gists are also backed by Git repos). (3 Mar 2022)
- [ ] Bug: Gists with large volumes of revisions take too long for an upstream service to return all the information and wind up responding with an HTTP 502. (3 Mar 2022)
- [ ] Feature: Return SSH URLs for Gists as is done for repositories; they currently only return HTTP cloning URLs, which I break apart and use to construct an SSH URL. (3 Mar 2022)

# Strava

- [ ] Bug: filter out obviously bad data that affects leaderboards; example given was multiple runners on a coastal segment that had elevation blips going from sea level to -32,000', then back up to 0', thus appearing to have climbed Mt. Everest several times! (long time ago)
- [ ] Feature: Add a joring option to skiing and biking. This way people don't take all the course records and leaderboards from people not using canine assistance. (23 Mar 2022)
